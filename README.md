# Artificial Intelligence - Lab Tasks

This repository contains a collection of practical assignments completed by **Bruno Delic** during university courses related to **Artificial Intelligence**.

## 🧠 Structure

The repository is divided into two main folders:

### 1. Optimization Methods
Includes Python implementations of various optimization algorithms and techniques studied in the course. Each task is organized in its own subfolder with:
- A `task.txt` file describing the assignment.
- A Python script with the implemented solution.

### 2. Natural Language Processing (NLP)
Covers key NLP concepts and hands-on projects, such as text preprocessing, sentiment analysis, and feature importance with SHAP. Each task is structured the same way:
- A `task.txt` file with the problem description.
- A corresponding Python file with the code solution.
