The daisy is a cheerful flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family, known for its classic appearance featuring white petals surrounding a yellow center. Daisies grow in a variety of climates and are among the most common wildflowers in the world.
The most familiar type is the common daisy (Bellis perennis), which thrives in grassy fields and lawns. It blooms from early spring through summer, symbolizing innocence, purity, and new beginnings in various cultures and traditions.
Daisies are heliotropic in their early stages and tend to close their petals at night and reopen in the morning, following the sun. This behavior has given rise to the phrase “fresh as a daisy.” These flowers are often used in bouquets, decorative arrangements, and even herbal medicine.
In the ecosystem, daisies provide nectar for bees, butterflies, and other pollinators. Some species also have medicinal properties and have been traditionally used to treat wounds, coughs, and digestive issues.
Simple, resilient, and beautiful, daisies bring charm to both natural meadows and cultivated gardens, making them a beloved favorite worldwide.
