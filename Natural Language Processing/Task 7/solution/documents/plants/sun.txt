The Sun is the star at the center of our Solar System and the primary source of light and heat for Earth. It is a nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma composed mainly of hydrogen and helium, with a diameter of about 1.39 million kilometersâ€”more than 100 times that of Earth.
The Sun's energy is produced through nuclear fusion in its core, where hydrogen atoms fuse to form helium, releasing vast amounts of energy. This energy radiates outward, powering life on Earth and driving weather, climate, and photosynthesis.
The Sun has several layers: the core, radiative zone, convective zone, photosphere, chromosphere, and corona. Solar activity, such as sunspots, solar flares, and coronal mass ejections, can affect space weather and disrupt communication systems on Earth.
Although it appears stable, the Sun is a dynamic, aging star. It is about 4.6 billion years old and is expected to remain in its current phase for another 5 billion years before expanding into a red giant and eventually shrinking into a white dwarf.
The Sun has been revered by civilizations throughout history and continues to be a major subject of scientific study due to its profound impact on Earth and the broader cosmos.
