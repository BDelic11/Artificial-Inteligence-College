Stars are massive, luminous spheres of hot gas—primarily hydrogen and helium—held together by gravity and powered by nuclear fusion. This fusion process converts hydrogen into helium and releases enormous amounts of energy in the form of light and heat.
The closest star to Earth is the Sun, but beyond it lie billions of stars in our galaxy, the Milky Way, and countless more in the observable universe. Stars come in various sizes, colors, and stages of life, from small red dwarfs to massive blue giants and eventually to white dwarfs, neutron stars, or black holes after their death.
Astronomers classify stars based on their temperature and brightness using the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. The study of stars helps scientists understand the age, structure, and evolution of galaxies.
Stars have captivated humanity for millennia, serving as tools for navigation, objects of wonder, and essential parts of myths and scientific discovery. Modern telescopes allow us to study stars in incredible detail, revealing their life cycles and distant exoplanetary systems.
