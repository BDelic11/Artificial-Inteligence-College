Penguins are flightless birds that live mainly in the Southern Hemisphere. The most iconic species, the Emperor penguin, can be found in Antarctica. Penguins have adapted to life in cold environments with their thick feathers and strong swimming abilities. They are known for their waddling walk and communal nesting habits.
