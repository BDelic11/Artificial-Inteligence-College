A black hole is a region in space where gravity is so strong that not even light can escape it. They form when massive stars collapse at the end of their life cycle. Black holes come in different sizes, from small stellar ones to supermassive black holes found at the centers of galaxies. They remain one of the most mysterious objects in the universe.
