Elephants are the largest land animals on Earth and are known for their intelligence, memory, and strong family bonds. There are two main species: the African elephant and the Asian elephant. Elephants use their trunks for communication, feeding, and bathing. Sadly, they are endangered due to poaching and habitat loss.
