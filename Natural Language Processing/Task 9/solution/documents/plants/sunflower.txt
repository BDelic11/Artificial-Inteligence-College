The sunflower (Helianthus annuus) is a tall, bright flower known for its large, yellow petals and round face that resembles the sun. Native to North America, sunflowers are not only admired for their beauty but also for their seeds, which are a source of oil and a healthy snack. These flowers follow the sunâ€™s movement across the sky, a behavior called heliotropism.
