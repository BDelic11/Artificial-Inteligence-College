Poppies are vibrant flowering plants known for their delicate petals and vivid colors, especially red. The most well-known species, the opium poppy (Papaver somniferum), has been used for medicinal purposes for centuries. Poppies are also a symbol of remembrance for soldiers who died in wars, especially in World War I.
