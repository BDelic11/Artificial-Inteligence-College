Daffodils are cheerful spring flowers with trumpet-shaped blooms, often yellow or white. They belong to the genus Narcissus and are among the first flowers to appear after winter. Daffodils are associated with new beginnings and are a symbol of hope in many cultures. They grow from bulbs and thrive in well-drained soil.
