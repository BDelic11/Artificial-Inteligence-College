The Sun is the star at the center of our solar system, providing the energy necessary for life on Earth. It is a nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma, primarily composed of hydrogen and helium. Through nuclear fusion, the Sun produces light and heat. It influences our climate, seasons, and day-night cycle.
