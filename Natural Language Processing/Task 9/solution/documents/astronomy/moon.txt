The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite and the fifth largest moon in the solar system. It affects the tides on Earth due to its gravitational pull. The Moon has phases based on its position relative to the Earth and Sun. Humans first landed on the Moon in 1969 during NASAâ€™s Apollo 11 mission.
