The lion (Panthera leo) is a large carnivorous feline known as the "king of the jungle." Lions live in social groups called prides, primarily found in Africa. Male lions are recognized by their majestic manes, while females do most of the hunting. Lions are apex predators and play an important role in their ecosystem.
