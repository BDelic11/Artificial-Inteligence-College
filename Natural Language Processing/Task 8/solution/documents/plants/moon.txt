The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite and the fifth-largest moon in the Solar System. It orbits Earth at an average distance of about 384,400 kilometers and takes approximately 27.3 days to complete one orbit. The same side of the Moon always faces Earth due to tidal locking.
The Moon has a significant influence on Earth. It causes ocean tides through gravitational pull and contributes to the stability of Earth's axial tilt, which affects climate and seasons. Its surface is covered in craters, mountains, and ancient lava plains known as maria.
Humans first visited the Moon in 1969 during NASA's Apollo 11 mission, when astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin became the first to walk on its surface. Since then, several missions have explored the Moon to study its geology and potential for future colonization.
The Moon continues to fascinate scientists and the public alike. It plays a key role in mythologies and calendars across cultures and is a primary target for future space exploration, including NASAâ€™s Artemis program, which aims to return humans to the lunar surface.
